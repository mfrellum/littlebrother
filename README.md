=============
More control of your part of the Big Data.
------------------------------------------

littlebrother  is a [mfrellum/seedProjects](https://github.com/mfrellum/seedProjects).

People like [Tim Berners Lee calls for new model for privacy on the web](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/11148584/Tim-Berners-Lee-calls-for-new-model-for-privacy-on-the-web.html).

### Docking your life
A personal [Docker](https://docker.io)-container to manage your metadata orcestrated with [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Git storage 
The individual is both a producer and consumer of data. In different contexts this will dictate where and what can be stored. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) can be a very flexible tool that can handle many of the challenges with this kind of data (access, encryption, merging etc).

### Feature goals (This project is just started. Most features are not implemented yet)
- It should be easy to move your metadata (standardized hosting)
- It will facilitate standardized data collection (support standards as IMS Caliper)
- personal data analysis
- sharing control
- black/gray/white-listing of metadata consumers
- easy and safe Container migration
- map-reduce schema for Big Data with littlebrother containers,
- encryption and archiving of metadata. (Internet proxy if allowed by host).
- aggregate several personal littlebrother containers (e.g. One for education, one for medical and one for leisure)
- littlebrother should handle offline/peer-to-peer-network aggregation of data (work together with an app like [funf](http://funf.org/) to handle real-time needs but at the same time "blure" data).
- something like OpenPDS's Safe-Answers 

### Stimulate hosting competition
Standardized hosting should make it easy to move your data and stimulate competition from hosting services.
Competition on:
- Trust
- Service
- Price

### Do we need littlebrother when we have openPDS?
I don't know and I will start by analysing [openPDS](http://openpds.media.mit.edu/).
