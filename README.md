littlebrother
=============
More control of your part of the Big Data. 
------------------------------------------
### Docking your life
A personal Docker-container for your metadata. 

### Feature goals (This project is just started. Most features are not implemented yet)
- It should be easy to move your metadatadata
- It will fasilitate standardized data collection (support standards as IMS Caliper)
- personal data analysis 
- sharing control 
- black/gray/white-listing of metadata consumers
- easy and safe Container migration 
- map/reduse schema for BigData with littlebrother containers, 
- encryption and archiving of metadata. (Internet proxy if allowed by host).
- aggregate several personalt littlebrother containers (e.g. One for education, one for medical and one fore lesiure)
- littlebrother should handle offline/peer-to-peer-network aggregation of data

### Do we need littlebrother when we have OpenPDS?
I don't know and I will start by analysing OpenPDS.
