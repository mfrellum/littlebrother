littlebrother
=============
More control of your part of the Big Data.
------------------------------------------
### Docking your life
A personal [Docker](https://docker.io)-container for your metadata.

### Feature goals (This project is just started. Most features are not implemented yet)
- It should be easy to move your metadata
- It will facilitate standardized data collection (support standards as IMS Caliper)
- personal data analysis
- sharing control
- black/gray/white-listing of metadata consumers
- easy and safe Container migration
- mapreduce schema for Big Data with littlebrother containers,
- encryption and archiving of metadata. (Internet proxy if allowed by host).
- aggregate several personal littlebrother containers (e.g. One for education, one for medical and one for leisure)
- littlebrother should handle offline/peer-to-peer-network aggregation of data

### Do we need littlebrother when we have openPDS?
I don't know and I will start by analysing [openPDS](http://openpds.media.mit.edu/).
