Ethical questions
=================
Regarding personal servers for metadata. 
---------------------------------------
See [Montjoye2014][1] for a good general discussion.

###What underlying legal fundament dictates the implementation and use of a system like littlebrother?
See [Lane2014][2] particulary chapter 8 for a good general discussion.

### Can ease of collection stimulate more collection?
If so? What are the consequenses?

### Does the users necessarily know the consequences of sharing?
If not? What are the consequenses?

### Can users be bullied into surrendering their data?
If so? What can be done?
E.g. insurance companies, future employer

### Can the physically storage of the metadata be anywere?
No. Why not? 
Examples?
Goverment restrictions: Russia, China, medical data

###You have the right to be forgotten, but do you have the right to share your privat data?
How can employer and nasjonal security agencyes restrict your sharing of privat data? You have different privacy contexts e.g.: work, citizent, privat, in a group. 
See [Lane2014, page 200][2] 

###What about Group metadata?
If your metadata contain references to other people can they demand to be disassociated? How do you solve that? A sentral register of per instant groups? that you can disassociate from?
